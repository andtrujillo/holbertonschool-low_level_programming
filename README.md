The C programming language is awesome because the majority of the world runs on computers and our first enterprise computers were Unix based and was the epitome of being gritty and hardworking as all the greatest minds in the world congregated to learn and invest time towards propelling the human race forward.

Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language as an American computer scientist. He is from New York and contributed to the Unix operating system and co-author'd the book, The C Programming Language. 

When speaking of linux and the open source community he says,

The C Programming language is a general-purpose programming language supported
by libraries to display text and graphic and to power embedded systems such as 
robots and large high tech machinery because its compiler provides low-level 
access to memory  and language grammar constructs that map efficiently to assembly 
code for quick retrieval of data and to consume a minimal amount of CPU cycles.
