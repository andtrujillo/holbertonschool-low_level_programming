The C programming language is awesome because the majority of the world runs on computers. Our first enterprise computers were Unix based and being the epitome of gritty and hardworking as all the greatest minds in the world congregated to learn and invest time towards propelling the human race forward.

## Founder of the C Language
Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language as an American computer scientist. He is from New York and contributed to the Unix operating system and co-author'd the book, The C Programming Language. 

When speaking of linux and the open source community he says, 
> "the continuation of ideas that were 
>    started by Ken and me and many others,
>     many years ago."

### Ansi Standard and the ISO
The standard specifies the representation of C programs and is built upon semantic rules and syntax which build upon the data processed and the data produced by the programs written in the C-Language. The International Standards Organization sets limits and restrictions to have an increasingly conforming standard for C-language implementations. The standard group does not impose limits on what machine nor mechanisms the C language implementation will exceed the capacity of any specific data processor or its system. 

#### Conclusion
The C Programming language is a general-purpose programming language supported
by libraries to display text and graphic and to power embedded systems such as 
robots and large high tech machinery because its compiler provides low-level 
access to memory  and language grammar constructs that map efficiently to assembly 
code for quick retrieval of data and to consume a minimal amount of CPU cycles.
